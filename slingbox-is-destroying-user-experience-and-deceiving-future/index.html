<p>A few days later, I received another software update. Thinking that it couldn’t get any worse, I installed it. Surprise surprise, now when I launch the Slingplayer application, I’m greeted with not only the two banner ads, but also a 15-30 second video ad. Below is the video ad, followed by the two banner ads.</p><p>As much as I enjoy hearing about great deals at Olive Garden and how Raisin Bran now has cranberries, they ruin the user experience. I use my Slingbox so I can watch TV. Watching TV means watching, or at least listening to, commercials. Adding launch commercials as well as banner and sidebar ads is downright disgusting and not why I purchased my Slingbox.</p><p>Ads aside, that’s not why I’m writing this. I’m writing this post because Slingbox is not only destroying user experience, but also deceiving future customers in the process. A quick visit to the <a data-grid-id="8fba0de5-8c62-472d-a994-06b9e8401a31" href="http://www.slingbox.com/">Slingbox</a> website or their<a data-grid-id="04731368-4191-4cf7-8a64-89908a2e01d5" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sling-Media-SlingTV-Slingbox-500/dp/B009FU8BR0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429856513&sr=8-1&keywords=slingbox">Amazon listing</a> shows no ads on any of their product screenshots and makes no mention of ads. If you go to their pressroom and download the <a href="http://www.slingbox.com/PressRoom/PressDownloads.aspx">press kit</a>, there are no product screenshots with ads either. You have to either own a Slingbox or read someone’s updated review to know that Slingbox now has ads.</p><p>Obviously, Slingbox added ads as an extra revenue stream. I get that. If you want to include it, fine. Go ahead, but it would’ve been nice to be informed ahead of time instead of pissing off all of your loyal customers. On top of that, deceiving future customers with misleading product screenshots and not informing them of the sidebar and banner ads is a terrible way to conduct business.</p><p>Customer first. Product second. Time to find an alternative.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Slingbox is destroying user experience and deceiving future customers</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
